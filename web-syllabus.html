			<h3>Recommended Text</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>The Internet</strong> - it turns out the world wide web is an excellent resource for researching itself (very meta). Please see resources tab for recommended starter list of self-referential online wisdom.  </li>
			</ul>   
			<p><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=web+development+tools&l=1" target="out"><strong>Example</strong></a></p>
			
			
			<h3>Materials</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Notebook</strong>(low tech device for taking notes).</li>
				<li><strong>Portable storage device</strong>: usb jump drive or portable external hard drive. -You are responsible for backing up work on a removable storage device.<br>
			Lost or corrupted work will not be accepted as an excuse for late/missing work.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Attendance</h3>
			<p>This class requires students to be present in order to create, review, and discuss the work that is being produced. Therefore, individual attendance is essential to the dynamic of the class as a whole. I allow 3 "get out of school free" absences (not applicable to critique days), every absence after that will result in the lowering of the final letter grade by 10%.  Tardiness (being late or skipping out early) counts as a .333 absence.</p>
			<p> Individual projects that are turned in late will result in the grade being lowered for that project. Feedback through the form of critique is also essential; absence from any of the class critiques will result in a drop of one letter grade for that assignment. </p>
			
			<h3>Critiques</h3>
			<p>I take critiques very seriously. Even if your project is not fully completed, it is required that you come to class to give feedback on your classmates’ projects. It will affect your grade negatively (drop one letter grade) if you do not show up for critique (this includes both days if the critique runs longer than one class period). Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need uploaded, tested and ready. Student computers will be shut off and full participation is expected.</p>
			
			<h3>Grading</h3>
			<p>Students will be assessed on conceptual ideas, technical skills, critical thinking, writing, oral presentation, participation and attendance. Student projects will be assessed on conceptual thought, creativity, originality and aesthetic qualities, demonstration of competent use of media tools, and work finished and presented on the due date. The final grade will be averaged from the project work, assignments, attendance, participation, writing and oral presentations. In order to counteract grade inflation, I do not give out A’s easily. If you turn in all your work on time (and if it is satisfactorily completed), and if you attend class and participate, you are ensured a C. A’s and B’s are reserved for students who excel beyond average and competent work. </p>
			<p>
			  A = excellent work <br>
			  B = above average work <br>
			  C= average or competent work <br>
			  D = below average work <br>
			  F = unsatisfactory work</p>
			<p>you are required to earn a C letter grade or higher in order to continue course work in the TAM program.</p>
			
			<h3>Freedom of Speech</h3>
			<p>This class is held in an academic university setting and due to the inherent nature of the internet and broad range of topics that your project work will explore it is inevitable that we will come across issues dealing with politics and religion. My role during such discussions will be a facilitator, a mediator, and as impartial as humanly possible. All students are encouraged to participate in open discussion and academic discourse.</p>
			
			<h3>Course Content</h3>
			The instructor of this class reserves the right to show a broad range of course materials, some of which assume the audience to be adult in age and demeanor. should a student feel offended by something they have seen or heard, it would appreciated, but not required, to stay to be part of the dialogue to offer your perspective. however if the student feels that they cannot stay, they are welcome to leave the classroom as discretely as possible. 
			
			<h3>Lab Policy</h3>
			<p>Food and drinks are not permitted inside the lab. this is not an open ITS lab, only students who are enrolled in the tam program should have access to the computers in 113,104, 105, and 225. Do not under any circumstance prop the doors open or let anyone in. If they are authorized to use the lab they will have their buff one cards activated.</p>
			
			<h3>Computers, Laptops and Mobile Computing Devices Usage Policy</h3>
			<p>Laptops and mobile computing devices can be a great asset to learning, but they can also be a source of distraction and actually impair the learning environment. Within ATLAS courses, computers, laptops and mobile computing devices should only be used for class related activities. Checking E-mail, “Facebooking,” working on assignments or projects for other courses, Instant Messaging, gaming and web-surfing are examples of unacceptable classroom behaviors. If you are found to be engaging in these activities during course time, Instructors reserve the right to ask you to leave the classroom.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the use of a cell-phones or texting devices during class is expressly verboten (forbidden).</p>
			
			<h3>Honor Code</h3>
			<p>All work/ideas/code must be original and created for this class - no project double-dipping or recycling of digital work from other course-work.<br>
			All code should be written from scratch by you - meaning that although some code is repeatable you should never copy and paste (steal) code from other sources and then find and replace (frankenstein) your content into it. <br>
			All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior.  All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html </a>and at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/">http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/</a></p>
			
			<h3>Classroom Behavior</h3>
			<p>Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline.

Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.  See policies at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html</a> and at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code">http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code</a></p>
